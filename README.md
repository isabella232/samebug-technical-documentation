# Samebug

## Search with a stack trace

By searching with a [stack trace](stacktrace.md) Samebug can provide you a
more relevant [solution](solutions.md)
to your software crashes. You don’t have to browse through endless forums
and developer communities.

## Find relevant solutions to your problem

### Check existing solutions

Our search engine has indexed more than 1,200,000 exceptions and its [solutions](solutions.md)
from the web. When searching with your [stack trace](stacktrace.md) we browse through our
continuosly growing database and select the most relevant solution.

### Ask for help from other developers

Samebug’s solution database is also run by the community. Based on your search result,
Samebug connects you to other community members, your [Bugmates](bugmates.md), who have
the same problem. You can [ask](help-request.md) or [provide](write-tip.md)
help to other community members.

### Mark the best solutions

The semantical stack trace similarity algorithm can find you the most relevant stack trace, but
not the most relevant content. We need the Community to rate the solutions in order to make
Samebug learn what are the good solutions.

## Privacy

[Your stack trace](privacy.md) belongs only to you. Once you register, Samebug will never
share your stack trace without your permission.

## Integrated with your IDE

Integration allows you to get solutions from the database, ask for help from
others with the same bug and write solutions without switching to the internet
and abandoning your workflow. Install it for [IntelliJ Idea](integration/intellij-idea/install.md)
or for [Android Studio](integration/android-studio/install.md).
