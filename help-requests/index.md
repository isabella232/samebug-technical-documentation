# Help requests

A help request is a stack trace and an optional description of the problem, that is
sent to [bugmates](/docs/bugmate) (Samebug users who can probably help).

## How to create a help request

You can open a help request when you [search](/docs/search) with a [stack trace](/docs/stack-trace). Click the 'Ask bugmates'
under the bugmate list; you can do this even when there are no bugmates at the moment.
You can write a description to give some context to the stack trace for the bugmates.

## How bugmates are notified

When you send your help request, Samebug will notify your bugmates in the most appropriate
manner for them: a notification in the [IDE](/docs/integration/intellij-idea/install) or in the browser, or an email. Moreover,
they will see their incoming help request on their [profile page](/docs/profile).

Samebug makes sure that the bugmates will find the stack trace in your help request relevant, however
it is not guaranteed that they already know the solution for that problem.

## How you get notified about the answer?

When someone answers your help request, Samebug notifies you with a notification in
the [IDE](/docs/integration/intellij-idea/install) or in the browser, or by an email.
Also, you can check your open help requests on your [profile page](/docs/profile).
