# Samebug integrations

Samebug is more than a web search engine for stack traces.
We want to provide you the most convenient way to deal with crashes right where you face them.

At the moment we offer plugins for [IntelliJ Idea](/guide/integration/intellij-idea/install)
and for [Android Studio](/guide/integration/android-studio/install).
The core feature of the IDE plugin is that it monitors the console and highlights stack traces
which have solution on Samebug. You can look over the solutions on the web, read and write tips,
and ask your bugmates for help without opening the browser.

Integration for Eclipse is currently under development. If you are interested of the Eclipse
plugin or want to ask integration for an other IDE, please [contact us](mailto:hello@samebug.io).
