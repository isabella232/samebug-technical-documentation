# Samebug integrations

Samebug is more than a web search engine for stack traces.
We want to provide you the most convenient way to deal with crashes right where you face them.

Currently we offer plugins for [IntelliJ Idea](/guide/integration/intellij-idea/install), [Android Studio](/guide/integration/android-studio/install) and [Eclipse](/guide/integration/eclipse).
The core feature of the IDE plugin is that it monitors the console and highlights stack traces
which have solution on Samebug. You can check out the solutions on the web, read and write tips
and ask your bugmates for help without opening the browser.

If you are interested in having an integration for another IDE, please [contact us](mailto:hello@samebug.io).
