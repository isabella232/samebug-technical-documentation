# Install the IntelliJ Idea plugin

The plugin allows you to use Samebug directly from IntelliJ Idea (or [Android Studio](../android-studio/install.md)),
get solutions or ask for help without abandoning your workflow.

JetBrains maintains a repository of plugins and offers seamless installation. However, when
something goes wrong you can fall back to manual installation.

## Prerequisites

You can install the plugin for IntelliJ Idea 15 or later versions.

## Best case: install from repository

Open the Settings window by pressing `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`S`, select Plugins and type 'samebug'
in the search box. Because Samebug is not maintained by JetBrains, you have to click the 
'Browse repositories' button on the bottom. Select Samebug and click 'Install' on the right.
Don't forget that you have to restart the IDE to make the install take effect.

## Install manually

It can happen that Idea is unable to find the plugin. In this case you have to download
the plugin from the JetBrains plugin repository and install manually.

1. Download the latest plugin version from the [repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8174-samebug)
2. Open the Settings window by pressing `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`S`, and click ‘Install plugin from disk…’ in the bottom right corner.
Select the zip file you downloaded in the first step and restart the IDE.
