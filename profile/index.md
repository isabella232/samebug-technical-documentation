# Samebug profile

We think that your activity on Samebug is something you should be proud of and share with the world.
You should not be ashamed about the crashes you have. They show your journey as a professional
developer. They show which libraries you have experience with, when you started
experimenting with a new technology and the progress you make.
Moreover, you can [write solutions](/guide/write-tip), actually help people having problems and collect
'Thanks' from other users to boost your profile.

To access your profile page, log into Samebug and click on your avatar at the top right. You can
see and change your profile information, and on the tabbed view you can have an overview of your activities.

## Overview

On this tab we show statistics about all your activities:

- Crashes: the number of [stack trace searches](/guide/search) you submitted to Samebug.
- Bugs: bugs are a collection of stack traces that Samebug thinks to be similar enough to treat them as the same.
E.g. if you submit exactly the same stack trace twice, they will count as two crashes, but one bug.
- Votes: the number of solutions you [marked as helpful](/guide/solution/rating-solutions).
- Crashtags: [crash tags](/guide/solution/crash-tag) are created when you mark a solution as helpful from a stack trace search.
- Tips: the number of [tips](/guide/write-tip) you wrote.
- Thanks: the number of times your [crash tags](/guide/solution/crash-tag) were [marked as helpful](/guide/solution/rating-solutions).
