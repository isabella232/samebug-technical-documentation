# Samebug profile

We think that your activity on Samebug is something you should be proud of and share with the world.
You should not be ashamed of the crashes you have. They show your journey as a professional
developer. They show which libraries you have experience with, when you started
experimenting with a new technology and the progress you make.
Moreover, you can [write solutions](/guide/write-tip), actually help people having problems and collect
'Thanks' from other users to boost your profile.
